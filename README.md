# Adta

Adta is **A**nother **D**amn **T**odo **A**pp - pronounced _Ay-Duh_, not _Add-Tah_ because I think it sounds better and you can only do _so_ much when coming up with these acronyms as app names ðŸ˜“

## Why?

I wanted to learn Tauri, as well as working with databases in Rust, so figured what better way to do both than making a todo application. Adta uses SQLite to store your todos, and SeaQL/SeaORM to manage them.
